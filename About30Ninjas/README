Notes on Milestone 4:
* Saving and Loading: You can save and load the game settings (volume and type of controller) across games with buttons in the main menu.
* Particles: have five particle systems (main menu, swords, end screen)
* Tweening: gravity in main menu, tweening on swords for swinging and parrying animations
* Juicy: Added some juice with sword trails and particles/sounds when swords clash
* Playable in 3-5 mins: Added two more levels and a score system that keeps track of who wins each round and does a best-of-three at the end for an overall winner.
* Behavior tree: used behavior tree for bugs underfoot, I originally tried to make the second player be an NPC to fight against but I wasn’t able to make the other player actually fight in a reasonable manner that wasn’t totally random and not useful

The first scene that should be loaded is “Main Menu”

Setup to be played with keyboard+mouse and a ps3 controller on Mac
Other setups may work incorrectly, I’ve been having issues with the input manager cross-platform and with different controllers

Controls:

Keyboard:
WASD to move
Mouse to aim
Mouse left and right to attack left and right
Q and E to parry left and right

Controller:
LS to move
RS to aim
LT and RT to attack left and right
LB and RB to parry left and right
